<h3>Portfolio Management - How am I doing?</h3>

<p>
The vast majority of portfolio tracking systems on other websites merely calculate how much you've gained (or lost) from your initial investment.   In some cases, they calculate your annual and total return percentage. Our system does all that and more.

<ul>
<li>Shows the return of current value compared to investment</li>
<li>Goes a step further to show total return including dividends.</li>
<li>Takes it a step further by comparing the stock's return to a benchmark 'index'.</li>
</ul>

"A rising tide lifts all boats" -- and a falling tide lowers them all. So if one of your stocks is down 10%, but the market as a whole is down 10%, you probably don't need to worry, the tide will eventually rise again.  But if your stock is down 20% and the market is still the same as when you bought the stock, your boat may be sinking.

The above illustrates the problem of setting a stop loss order for protection when you buy a stock.  If the overall market falls (including your stock) the stop loss order may be triggered and you will book a real loss.

Our system allows you to receive alerts if your stock price falls below your selected benchmark by a percentage you choose.
